          <h3>Jack Torrance</h3>
          <h4>Played by Jack Nicholson</h4>
          <p>Jack is a writer who takes on a job as the isolated Overlook Hotel's acting manager during its winter closure. Having lost his job as a prep school teacher, Jack believes his new job will provide the fresh start that he and his family need, as well as the time and space to write, his new profession. Jack begins the film as a relatively sympathetic character and might even be mistaken for its protagonist at the beginning of the film, as he is ambitious and intelligent, even though he has a history of abusing his son. As the film plays out, however, Jack takes on a role as the story's clear antagonist, possessed as he is by the evil spirits of the Overlook Hotel, which compel him to become increasingly possessive of his writing and dangerous to his wife and son.</p>

          <h3>Wendy Torrance</h3>
          <h4>Played by Shelley Duvall</h4>
          <p>Wendy is the fragile, timid wife of Jack and mother to Danny. She is a good mother and often present for her son's strange bouts with telepathy, as opposed to her often absent husband, Jack. Although Wendy initially attempts to remain sympathetic to Jack's increasingly volatile fits of rage in response to her intrusion on his writing, she eventually comes to see him as a threat to her and Danny. She is forced to summon her strength to fight against him as her once semi-harmonious family life morphs into one of the bona fide horror movies she used to love.</p>

      <h3>Danny Torrance</h3>
      <h4>Played by Danny Lloyd</h4>
      <p>Danny is the son of Jack and Wendy Torrance. He is gifted (or cursed) with powerful telepathic and psychic abilities that enable him to communicate with the evil spirits present in the Overlook Hotel and to see visions of the future before it happens. Danny has an imaginary friend named Tony, who often speaks through Danny to warn him and his mother of danger. Danny is shy and secretive about his psychic abilities, telling only the hotel's chef, Dick Hallorann, about his powers. Much of the film is explored through Danny's point of view, and many identify him as its protagonist.</p>
